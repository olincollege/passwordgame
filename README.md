# The Password Game

## Summary
"The Password Game" is a game that challenges players to create a password that abides by an increasingly difficult and ridiculous set of rules. We built the game using a model-view-controller architecture, with the Python coding language, and using a variety of libraries, notably including "pygame." Through a graphical user interface (GUI), players are met with immediate feedback and engaging visualizations as they progress through all of the crazy password rules. The rules range from basic requirements such as length or capitalization requirements to increasing difficult ones such as including roman numerals or the fibonacci sequence. Once all of the rules are satisfied, the player has won!

## Installation Instructions
To install and play "The Password Game," you will need Python and a few libraries. Ensure you have the latest version on Python installed on your system, and then install the following three libraries in within the terminal using pip:

```
pip install pygame
pip install sympy
pip install better_profanity
```
**As long as python and these libraries are installed and all the game files** (`model.py`, `view.py`, `controller.py`, and `main.py`) **are in the same directory** (*which they should be by default*)**, then you're ready to play.** No additional changes to the code are necessary unless you would like to modify or add your own game rules and graphics!

## How to Start the Game
To start the game, navigate to the directory containing the game files and run the following command in your terminal:

```
python main.py
```
