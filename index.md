## The Big Idea (& Highlights)
"The Password Game" is a fun and interactive game that challenges players to create a password that meets a complex and increasingly ridiculous set of rules. Utilizing the model-view-controller architecture, the game provides real-time feedback and animations, enhancing user experience as players progress through each rule. The goal is to satisfy all the quirky requirements, including integration of elements like roman numerals, Fibonacci sequence, and even Morse code, culminating in a celebration sequence once all criteria are met.
