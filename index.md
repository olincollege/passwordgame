# The Password Game
By Arman Ozsu, Kristin Xu, and Luke Zahner at Olin College

## What's The Password Game?
"The Password Game" is a fun and interactive game that challenges players to create a password that satisfies a complex and increasingly ridiculous set of rules. We built it using the model-view-controller architecture. The goal is to satisfy all the quirky requirements, including integration of elements like roman numerals, Fibonacci sequence, and even Morse code, which triggers a celebration sequence once all criteria are met! Notable aspects about the game include that it provides real-time feedback and animations, has a unique set or rules/requirements, and prohibits inappropriate word entry.
