"""
Unit testing module for the game's components.

This module contains comprehensive unit tests
for the various components of the game, including
the GameModel, GameController, and GameView.
It utilizes the Python unittest framework to 
ystematically verify the functionality of each component,
ensuring they operate correctly both in isolation
and in conjunction when simulated conditions are applied.

The tests cover a range of scenarios:
- Initial states of the game components to
     confirm proper setup.
- Functional behavior such as input handling,
    game state updates, and rendering.
- Edge cases and error handling to ensure the game
    maintains stability under unusual conditions.

Classes:
    TestGameModel: Tests the integrity and logic of the
        GameModel class, ensuring all game rules are correctly
        applied and the state is accurately maintained.
    TestGameController: Validates that the GameController
        correctly processes user input and system events,
        managing the flow of game logic appropriately.
    TestGameView: Confirms that the GameView renders
        the game's state accurately, updating visuals
        based on changes in the model.

    Tests include validating the initialization

    Methods in this class are designed to test:
    - Initialization and default state of the game model.

    user input and game logic.

    Each test method in this class is prefixed

#Unit tests for Controller

    Unit tests for the GameController class to

    This testing class assesses the GameController's

    ensures that user inputs are correctly interpreted and
    that appropriate actions are taken based on those inputs.

    Key areas tested include:
    - Initialization and the starting state of the game loop.
    - Response to various key press events, such as moving
    through menu options or in-game actions.
    - Proper handling of game state updates and transitions,
    ensuring the controller reacts as expected to model changes.
    - Graceful shutdown of the game loop in response to quit events.

    Methods are typically structured to simulate specific
    events and then verify that GameController
    behaves correctly, updating both the game's state
    and its visual representation as needed.

    the display of player stats, game menus, and other interface elements.

    and verifies that these changes are appropriately
    reflected in the GameView's output on the screen.
